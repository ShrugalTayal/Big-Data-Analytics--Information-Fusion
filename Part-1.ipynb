      "Title D2:  Abstract—Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken- centroid discriminant analysis (RDA), and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject. This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using pre- movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to 400ms before force onset in the pre- movement signals, captured by electrodes placed over the limb- ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning. I. INTRODUCTION Decoding human arm movement has been a major goal of motor brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the development\n"

Дане явище, коли кожен пристрій отримав змогу обмінюватися службовими даними, отримало назву «інтернет речей» (internet of things, IoT). При такому швидкому розвитку подій, з’явилася необхідність у розробці дієвих протоколів обміну даними та пристроїв, що будуть цей обмін забезпечувати, оскільки стандартні протоколи, що використовуються у традиційних мережах не можуть в повній мірі задовольнити потреб нового типу мереж, що стали називати сенсорними. Дані мережі повинні мати змогу до самоорганізації, оскільки налаштовувати вручну мережу на кожному новому пристрої досить проблематично. Окрім того, вони повинні автоматично відновлювати розірвані з’єднання та знаходити нові маршрути при динамічній зміні топології мережі, оскільки більшість з пристроїв, які об’єднує концепція IoT є досить мобільними,\n",

The performance of the MEMS gyroscope is impacted by mismatch in the frequency of oscillation between the two vibrating axes resulting from the effect of external disturbances and time varying model parameters [1]. Performance can be improved by designing a closed loop controller to negate the effects of external disturbances and time varying model parameters . In this paper we develop a novel the Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Controller (FOSMC) combined with a Super-Twisting Controller (STC) to control a MEMS gyroscope Yang and Liu numerically considered the FOSMC for a new hyperchaotic structure [4]. Gao and Liao presented integral sliding mode control to enhance robustness of FOSMC [5]. Balochian used variable structure control for an individual polytopic system with fractional order operator. A specific feedback law is considered by proposing a sliding surface with fractional order operator [6]. Rabah et al. guaranteed asymptotic stability of fractional systems, by provided a novel technique of FOSMC [7]. Shah and Mehta described Thiran’s\n",
